Your study consists of your research question, theory, conceptual definitions, measurement design, procedural design, analyses, results, and conclusions. A good study, all of these different parts of a study are tailored to each other. 

The MATILDA website aims to help you align your research question with your measurement design in the context of studies that use intensive longitudinal data (ILD) to study social science processes. 

Below we have specified multiple topics to think about with respect to the outset of your study - such as your research question and goals, theory, and research paradigm.
