This is the landing page for everything related to the <i> ergodicity </i> of the [process](../processes.qmd) you are studying.

If a process is ergodic, it does not matter *when* we measure it, or for *what units* (i.e., what persons) we measure it, the process always has the same distributional characteristics: The process is the same in terms of mean, variance, etc. 

In that case, on the population level relationships between variables obtained from inter-individual differences are the same as the relationships between those variables obtained from intra-individual differences.

For a process to be ergodic it needs to be a) stationary and b) homogeneous. Whether a process is stationary or homogeneous are [research questions](../your-study/research-questions.qmd), and the answer to those questions are important:

- for how we should measure the process, that is, to what extent we should worry about for whom or what time points we measure the process;
- for how we should analyze the process, that is, do we need to allow for changes in the process across time or across units;
- for what conclusions we can draw, that is, can we generalize our results to all time points, and all units, or not.
