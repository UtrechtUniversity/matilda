This page is about floor and ceiling effects in empirical psychological data, which occur when the measurement instrument has a lower or upper bound. 

For example, floor effects are common in ILD collected for 'Negative Affect': Healthy people often experience fairly little positive affect, and hence a lot of their scores will be equal or close to zero.

It is important to consider these effects, because: 

a) Understanding how and why these effects occur are an important part of understanding and controlling the measurement process (measurement theory);

b) Understanding how and why these effects occur are an important part of understanding the substantive process under study (substantive theory);

c) These effects may have consequences for analyzing and modeling the resulting ILD. Understanding when, how and why these effects occur allow you to find optimal ways to do the analysis/modeling. 

On this page we discuss what floor and ceiling effects are; theories on the possible mechanisms leading to floor and ceiling effects; ways of detecting these effects in a given data set;  implications and consequences of these effects for common models used in psychological research; and possible ways to deal with these effects.

<!-- I think this page should discuss both floor and ceiling effects in the end.
-->

<!-- This content for now may be a bit much/ not enough on measurement theoretical level. Maybe we need to split this into multiple pages, for example a basic one of floor/ceiling effects, another on the staging effect, another on consequences/modeling (maybe the latter is more for a modeling site). For now, I have removed a lot from this page.

# What are floor effects? {#sec-what-is-floor-effect}

Many scales used in psychological research have a lower bound. This means that individuals cannot or do not score less than a certain value on the scale. 

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Example: Count Variables

Count variables - variables that measure how many times something occurs - often have a clear lower bound: 

- Hours of sleep - a person cannot sleep less than zero hours.

- Smoking frequency - a person cannot sleep less than zero cigarettes.

- Stressfull events - a person cannot face less than zero stressful events in a day.
:::

Some individuals may typically score at or close to the lower bound of the scale for a given construct. This results in a clustering of measurements around the lower bound of the scale, which results in a positively skewed distribution of responses, with relatively small variability for that construct. This phenomenon is often referred to as a *floor effect*.

In interindividual difference variables, floor effects occur when many of the participants score at the lower bound. In intra-individual difference variables, floor effects occur for single participants, when many of the repeated measures of that participant are at the lower bound. 

Floor effect can arise for both discrete and continuous variables, and for various types of scales, including likert and sliding scales.

## Example: Floor effects in distress measurements
<!-- Think about credit/copyright of the figure, and openness of the data --> 

@fig-cogito-distress-histograms shows histograms for each participants' repeated measures of distress, from the COGITO dataset [@schmiedek_2010_HundredDaysCognitive]. Participants' distress was measured for about 100 consecutive days. 

The histograms are sorted by the mean distress scores of the individuals, from low to high means. A strong floor effect is evident for more than half of the individuals.

<!-- note that for the last participant there is a ceiling effect -->

# Why Do Floor Effects Occur? {#sec-how-floor-effect-emerges}

Multiple factors may induce the floor effect in empirical data.

It can be due to the properties of the measurement design or instrument, due to the nature of measured construct and process --- or due to a combination of these factors.

<!-- I think we should link these reasons to known jargon in the literature, also related to distributions.
That is, censoring -->

## Floor effects due to the measurement design or intrument

### A. Censoring as a result of coarse-grained categories at the bottom of the scale

<!-- Explain what this means in general terms, then do the headache example in an example box 
Note: I think this is actually censoring as well, because you essentially make a '> slight headache' bound --> 

Imagine a scale with the lowest item being "No headache at all or very slight headache".
The item will be selected by those who are experiencing no headache at all as well as those who have a small amount of headache, meaning that the item has low resolution and low sensitivity in measuring those with small amount of headache.
For a more elaborate account, see @vermeersch_2000_OutcomeQuestionnaireItem.

<!-- why is the below relevant for floor/ceiling effects? Either remove or make that link explicit and clear 
From a psychometric perspective, such lack of sensitivity may also arise due to extreme formulation of the items, causing the *difficulty parameter* (or *threshold*) of the item to become high[@vandenoord_1997_NoteUseTobit], thus making it difficult accurately to distinguish between levels of the construct across individuals or its change over time within an individual [@guyatt_1988_MeasuringHealthStatus].

### B. Censoring as a result of measuring a bipolar construct with a unipolar scale
<!-- Explain what this means in general terms, then do the happy/sad example in an example box --> 

Some affect and mood items, like *sad*, can be thought of as measuring one half of a bipolar latent continuum, say, *happy--sad*.
As such, being *not at all sad* is equivalent to being *neither happy nor sad*.
In this case, measuring one half of the latent construct with a unipolar scale can be thought of as systematically left-sensoring the data.
As @falcaro_2013_AnalysingCensoredLongitudinal [p. 12] put it:

> The depression score variable in this study suffered a marked floor effect at 0.
> We decided to treat this as a special case of interval censoring.
> Under this model we are assuming that those who score at the floor of the test could have been further differentiated into varying levels of non-depression if there had been appropriate additional items.
> Most people would call such variation in non-depression variation in happiness but, in the absence of actual happiness items and evidence of their tapping the same dimension as the depression items, the labelling of any such implicit variability is best left open.

### C. Censoring by participants
::: callout-warning
This section is a stub.
:::

Participants give meaning to the start/end of a scale which turns out not extreme enough - later on they experience more extreme emotions, but they are bounded by the initial interpretation they gave to the start/end of a scale.

### D. Sampling issues or non-at random missing observations.
::: callout-warning
This section is a stub.
:::

People only fill out questionnaires when they are at the lower end of the scale.
Either participant induced: Missing non-at random observations. (tending to miss extreme scores at the end of the scale, e.g., for feeling anger) 
Or by design: Could for example happen if you do  event-contingent sampling and only observe variables in the context of relative extreme events (you only measure people when they have a panic attack, resulting in seeming ceiling effects for anxiety).

## Floor effects due to the nature of the measured construct or process

## E. Processes with specific distributional nature
<!-- This can use some polishing -->
<!-- First explain in general terms, than use examples in separate example boxes. -->
<!-- Some ideas for sensible examples: 
E.g., maybe strong emotions like 'inspired' only occur with specific relatively rare events, then you would expect ceiling effects if you have a sampling design that measures throughout the day rather than only those events.

Most healthy people simply don't experience a lot of symptoms throughout the day.

Count variables would again be a good example box
-->

It is possible that some psychological processes, in nature, produce data with non-symmetric distributions, such that they have a higher density (or mass) near zero.
Such processes, especially when dealing with counts---or constructs that can be approximated with counts---may follow, for instance, the binomial distribution [see @iachina_2012_MeasuringReliableChange], Poisson distribution, or skewed distributions akin to the $\chi^2$ distribution.

<!-- Maybe add this ref below in a read more box, and also cite it in the previous sentence --> 
See @haqiqatkhah_2022_SkewnessStagingDoes for an elaborated account of three plausible processes.

## F. Processes consisting of two sub-processes (zero-inflation)
<!-- This can use some polishing -->
<!-- First explain in general terms, than use examples (diet/smoking/etc in separate example boxes) -->
Some behavioral and psychological processes can be thought of as a mixture of two processes: One acting as an on--off switch (determining whether the process is active or not), and another process generating non-zero values.
It has been suggested that dietary intake [@ruf_2021_StudyingDietaryIntake], smoking behavior [@liu_2007_GrowthCurveModels], and certain affective processes [@lu_2019_ZeroInflatedRegimeSwitchingStochastic] might be better explained in this framework.
It is worth noting that such processes can explain the excess number of zero values (or zero inflation) in the data; if the data skewed beyond zero inflation, the "on" process still needs to account for a "floor effect" that is present above zero.
