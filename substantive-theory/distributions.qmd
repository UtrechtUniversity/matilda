This is the landing page for everything related to the <i> distributions </i> of your constructs of interest.

With distribution we mean how your scores are distributed across the units you are studying. For ILD we are often interested in how scores are distributed over time for a given unit (e.g., a person). We may also be interested in how scores are distributed across units (e.g., multiple persons). 

The distributions of variables imply what scores you should expect for the process you are studying. Having knowledge about the distribution of your variables of interest is useful for informing your designing your measurement instrument and sampling design. It is also important to take into account when you analyse collected data.

## Think More About Distributions

We have collected various topics for you to read more about below.
