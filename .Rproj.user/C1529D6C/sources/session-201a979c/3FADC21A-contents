# Time Scales: A Key Consideration for Measuring ILD

To ensure the measurement of a process aligns with the theory and research questions we have, it is paramount to determine the time scale at which the process is assumed to unfold, and match this with the time scale at which we observe the process.

To illustrate the importance of considering the timescale of a process, consider:

a.  The answer to a research question may differ depending on the timescale considered.

## Example: Raising kids

Louise studies how specific actions from the parents affect the behavior of their children. When focusing on how to best handle the tantrums of a toddler who demands a cookie, it becomes clear that in the short-run, it is beneficial to give the toddler a cookie: They calm down and the tantrum seems to dissipate. But in the longer run, when the parent keeps offering cookies whenever the toddler is upset, the number of tantrums increases and the toddler is demanding cookies much more frequently and more fiercely. Thus, while providing a cookie represents an instant gratification at the lower time scale, repeatedly providing a cookie teaches the child to behave in a certain way to get it their way.

b.  Different research questions may require studies at different time scales, even if they are about the same general constructs.

<!-- Another good example -->

c.  It may be the case that there are various processes that operate at different time scales, that all contribute to our measurements (whether we like it or not). For instance, at a shorter time scale (e.g., minute-to-minute), a regulatory process may be at play, while at a longer time scale (e.g., week-to-week), a developmental process may be taking place.

## Example: Typing

Steve is interested in studying the relation between accuracy and speed in a typing task. When considering the relation between accuracy and speed at a short time scale (minute to minute), it becomes clear that these variables are negatively correlated: Tasks on which a participant types faster are characterized by more mistakes. Yet, when allowing the participant to train a lot, it becomes clear that both speed and accuracy increase over time: This shows the effect of learning, which takes place at a longer time scale.

## Think More About Time Scales

There are many things to consider with respect to substantive theory, measurement theory, and measurement design that relate to time scales. We have collected various topics for you to read more about below.

# Practical Considerations

The following practical considerations are also important for the decision about time scales, but are not considered further on this website.

-   Material considerations (funding, available personnel, available measurement applications) will naturally affect the duration of a study, and how many and how intensively one may collect repeated measures, and hence what time scales may be studied.
