abstract = {Catastrophe theory can be very useful in research concerning developmental transitions. It provides a number of canonical transition models as well as criteria which can be used for the detection of transitions in experimental research. In this contribution the relevance of using catastrophe theory in cognitive developmental research is discussed. In particular, emphasis is placed on the detection criteria and their operationalizations in conservation research, as well as to fitting techniques for canonical transition models with respect to their applicability and robustness., 19 October 1995, 8 August 1997},
