This page considers several theoretical implications for deciding for
single or multiple items to measure a construct.

In case a single item is used, the response to this single item is used
in further analyses and results for the study. A common example of a
construct for which single items are often used is 'age'.

In case multiple items are used to measure a construct, some aggregation
is performed on the multiple items to get a single measure for usage in
analyses and results: For example, by creating a sum score or mean
score, or by using some statistical measurement model to do this (e.g.,
a latent variable model such as a factor model or item respons theory
model). Common examples of constructs for which multiple items are often
used are 'math ability', 'depression' and 'agreeableness'.

Read more about using single, or multiple items, below.

# Measuring your construct(s) with single items

In psychology we have had a tradition of relying on multiple item
measures for measuring constructs that we cannot directly observe or
derive (e.g. positive/negative affect). Single items are usually mainly
used for constructs that are more straightforward to directly observe or
derive (e.g., age or occupation).

For ILD, researchers more often reach for single items measures even in
the former case. Often, this is for important practical reasons, such as
keeping the burden for participants low (see a list of practical
considerations at the end of this page). However, considerations related
to theory can and should also play a role in this decision: For example,
a single item may be deemed sufficient, or the most direct, or the most
clear, way of measuring the construct of interest. Or, perhaps standard
latent variable theory, that is usually the basis of multiple item
measures (read more [here](/)), may be deemed unsuitable for a construct
.

## Example: Social Support 1

Kim wants to get a good impression of someone's daily experienced
received social support. They want to a) keep close to the participants
own impression and interpretation of the social support the participants
experienced b) keep the participants' burden low.

Kim decides to use a single item asking 'To what extent did you feel
supported by others today?", rather than asking multiple questions. Kim
will use the responses to this item for further analyses on the
construct experienced social support.
:::

In any case, it is key is to research and evaluate the performance of
the measurement instrument, just like for multiple item measures. Using
single items does not have to be problematic, if a single item gives a
good enough measurement of the construct of interest for the research
goals. As is the case for multiple item measures, it is essential to
(find ways to) evaluate whether this is the case.

# Measuring your construct(s) with multiple items

There can be many reasons for why a researcher may choose to study a
construct with multiple items. Common reasons researchers choose for
this, in our experience, are:

a)  content validity (measuring all relevant aspects of a construct);

b)  reliability (to account for measurement error);

c)  mirroring traditional/interindividual difference (e.g.,
    cross-sectional) research (use a similar questionnaire to what is
    used in cross-sectional or other interindividual difference
    studies).

It is important to realize that each of these reasons for opting for
multiple items has theoretical implications, and these may be different,
and potentially not reconcilable with each other. Read more about these
three reasons below.

## Multiple items for reasons of content validity

Asking multiple questions, or using multiple items, to cover all
relevant aspects of the construct of interest. The different items are
used to measure different important aspects of the relevant construct.
The responses to these multiple items are aggregated in some way to get
an overall measure of the construct of interest. This aggregate may then
be used for further analyses.

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Example: Social Support 2

Max wants to get a good impression of someone's daily experienced
received social support. To get an impression of all relevant aspects of
social support for their study, Max breaks down the construct into
different aspects, measured with different items. Rather than using a
single item asking 'How much social support did you receive today?",
they asked multiple questions like"Did you receive help with your job
today?","Did you feel you could reach out for emotional support from
your friends/family/colleagues today?", and"Did you rely on financial
support today?", covering various aspects of receiving social support.
To get an overall measure of experienced social support for further use
in their analyses, Max will aggregate the responses to these items;
either using a mean score or a more complex latent variable model.

Note: Max may also choose to use a single item in their analyses next to
their overall aggregated measure of social support: For example, by also
using "Did you rely on financial support today?" as a single item
measure of the construct received financial support. In this case, Max
uses both single item measures, and multiple item measures in their
study.
:::

If you consider using multiple items to improve content validity,
carefully consider the theoretical implications of how you should
aggregrate the multiple items into a single measure to be used in your
analyses.

## Multiple items for reasons of reliability

Having multiple items to measure the same construct can be helpful,
because it allows using internal consistency reliability approaches. For
these techniques, the general idea is that the items all measure the
same underlying construct. The shared variance among those items is the
result of variation in the true construct, while the unshared variance
among the items is considered measurement error.

Multiple items that measure the same construct, combined with internal
consistency reliability approaches can be used to

a\) estimate the reliability of (a set of) items for measuring a
construct of interest. That is, to validate a questionnaire.

b\) in order to account for measurement error for a construct of
interest during an analysis. That is, to prevent measurement error from
biasing the results of analyses.

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Example: Social Support 3

Ume has developed a short experience-sampling questionnaire where three
items are used to measure daily experienced received social support. The
items are "I felt supported by others today...", "I felt grateful to
others today..." and "Other people had my back today...". The shared
variance in the items over time is considered variance in the 'true'
received social support, and the unique variance in the items over time
is considered measurement error.
:::

Well-known internal consistency approaches for interindividual (e.g.,
cross-sectional) studies are reliability measures such as Cronbach's
Alpha, and latent variable models such as factor models and Item
Response Theory models. These techniques cannot be used directly on
intensive longitudinal data, but extensions and similar alternatives are
available.

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Example: Social Support 4

Ume uses a reflective linear factor model with the three items as
indicators, and one latent variable that should reflect 'received social
support'. They use the model to estimate the reliability for their short
questionnaire, as part of their validation study. Reliability will be
high when the items consistently increase and decrease together over the
repeated measures (if they covary a lot of time).

If the questionnaire is deemed valid based on Ume's study, in future
studies researchers can use the same factor model to correct for
measurement error in their analyses.
:::

When using multiple items for reliability purposes, it is important to
realize

a)  that each internal consistency reliability technique is based on
    theoretical assumptions, and hence has theoretical implications. It
    is important to carefully think about what measurement model is
    appropriate for your research question and context.
b)  it is possible to evaluate reliability and correct for measurement
    error with single item measures as well (see: [Reliability for
    single item measures (for single or multiple subjects)](/)).

## Multiple Items to Mirror Interindividual Difference Questionnaires

Researchers may want to use constructs established in interindividual
difference research for intra-individual difference studies using ILD:
For example, constructs such as 'positive affect' or 'introversion'. In
that case, the first intuition may be to simply take the questionnaires
from inter-individual difference research and adapt them to the
intra-individual context.

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Example: PANAS 1

A researcher wants to measure intra-individual differences in 'Positive
Affect' and 'Negative Affect', constructs established in the context of
individual differences research. It is commonly measured with the PANAS
Schedule (refs). It measures how much positive and negative affect
people tend to generally experience, and is used to study trait
differences between people in how much positive and negative affect the
tend to experience, and how this relates to other differences between
people (e.g., their sex or personality traits).

The researcher takes the original items of the PANAS scale, and but
changes the phrasing to suit intra-individual difference research.

For example: The original PANAS instructions were "Indicate the extent
you have felt this way over the past week." for various adjectives
(e.g., "irritable", "guilty", "afraid"), rated on a 5 point likert scale
("very slightly/not at all" - "extremely"). The researcher changes the
instruction to "Indicate the extent you have felt this way in the last
hour.", keeping the remaining the same.
:::

It is important to consider the following:

-   constructs established interindividual difference research may be less relevant, or irrelevant for studying intra-individual differences. 
    
::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"} 
## Example PANAS 2
Based on interindividual difference research, the items "irritable", "guilty", "afraid" (and others) are considered suitable items for establishing consistent differences in 'overall negative affect' among different people (refs). Based on factor modeling studies, it has been established that people that tend to overall feel more irritable than other people, tend to also feel more guilty and afraid than other people. This property is captured in a latent variable, which is considered to capture differences in people's overall 'negative affect'.

If we carry over the 'negative affect' latent variable to intra-individual differences over time, using on the same adjectives as the original scale, we would need to establish the following pattern over time: If a person feels relatively irritable at a certain occasion, that person tends to also feel relatively guilty and afraid at that same occasion. 

Consider, however, that actually whether a person feels irritable at a given occassion, and whether the person also feels guilty and afraid, depends mainly on the context the participant is in at that occasion. For some experiences (participant is publicly called out on a big mistake) they may feel all three emotions to a large extent, while for other experiences (participant encounters an angry swarm of bees during a walk) they may be inclined to feel mostly one of them. 

If so, the concept of general negative effect may turn out not so directly relevant for studying how people's emotions fluctuate over time (intra-individual differences); while it is very suitable for studying general tendencies of people compared to other people (interindividual differences).
:::

- questionnaires for intra-individual difference studies, often need to have different qualities than questionnaires on inter-individual differences. 

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"} 
## Example: PANAS 3
Consider the PANAS adjective 'guilty', for which participants now would "Indicate the extent you have felt this way in the last hour." If one collects relatively few repeated measures over a short time span, participants may often or even always respond 'not at all/very slightly' for the majority of measures. This would result in little to no within-person variance in the repeated measures of guilt, making intra-individual difference analyses difficult or impossible.

In comparison, for studying (stable) interindividual differences or traits, the timing of measurements is often less important compared to getting a representative varied sample of participants.
:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"} 
## Example: PANAS 4
While the original PANAS for interindividual differences consists of 20 items, we may prefer a shorter questionnaire for an intra-individual difference study where we collect repeated measures every hour. 
:::

- valid and reliable questionnaires from inter-individual difference research, may not be valid and reliable for intra-individual difference research. 

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"} 
## Example: PANAS 5
While the original PANAS for interindividual differences may have a reliability between .8-.9 (refs), an adapted PANAS for intra-individual differences may have a much lower or higher reliability [@schuurman2019measurement].
:::

Hence, questionnaires or items adapted from interindividual difference
research need to be completely re-validated.

We generally recommend to avoid copying constructs from interindividual
research directly to intra-individual difference studies unless there
are very good theoretical reasons to do so. That is, the constructs need
to make sense for studying intra-individual differences, for the given
research question, and context, preferably backed by empirical evidence. In many cases it may be more fruitful to establish (new) constructs tailored to intra-individual differences.

# Practical Considerations

The following practical considerations are also important for the decision between single vs. multiple items, but are not considered
further on this website.

-   By measuring constructs with a single item, rather than multiple
    items, this can reduce the burden on participants - Only single
    items may be used if there is (so far) no good conceivable way to
    create multiple items that measure the same construct without
    participants reacting to this in an undesirable way (e.g., such as
    checking with the previous items to get the exact same score on the
    current item; getting bored/annoyed by the similar questions, etc).
-   If one wants to correct for measurement error, statistical
    measurement models with multiple items tend to be easier to estimate
    than statistical measurement models with single items
    [@schuurman2019measurement].
