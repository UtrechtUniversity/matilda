This is the landing page for topics related to the <i> validation </i> of measurements.

Validating a measurement means to evaluate whether our measurement instrument is measuring what it is supposed to measure. Validating measurement instruments is a key part of doing any study, ILD studies included: if our measures are invalid, our results may be more or less meaningless. 

There are various approaches to validating a measurement instrument, ranging from doing qualitative studies to see what participants make of the items you designed, to using statistical models to estimate the reliability of an item. Typically, it will require multiple of these approaches together (triangulation) to ensure our measurement instrument is actually valid. 

Read more about various topics related to the validation of ILD studies below.
