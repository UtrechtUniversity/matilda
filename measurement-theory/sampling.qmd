This is the landing page for everything related to the <i> sampling procedure </i> used for measuring your [constructs](../your-study/constructs.qmd) of interest. 

They way your sampling procedure is designed will directly impact what you will be able to capture about your construct. 

## Think more about your sampling design

We have collected various topics for you to read more about below.
