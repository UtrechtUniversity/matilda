This is the landing page for topics related to defining your <i> research question </i> for your [intensive longitudinal](../../intensive-longitudinal-data.qmd) study.

Your research question is the place of departure for making all kinds of decisions with respect to your study design, measurement design, analyses, and via these choices determines the conclusions you will be able to draw. It is hence a good idea to make a research question as clear and precise as possible. Then you will able to evaluate to what extent your choices will allow you to learn what you want to learn, and optimize your design for your question. Specifying your research question may take multiple iterations and refinements. 

Below we have specified multiple topics that may help you do this.
