This is the landing page for topics related to establishing the <i> theory </i> that ties into your [intensive longitudinal](../../intensive-longitudinal-data.qmd) research.

A theory explains why or how your [process](../../processes.qmd) of interest works the way it does. Theory formation - the building and specification of a theory - is an essential part of ILD research: It helps establish what knowledge we have about about our process, and where we have knowledge gaps. These gaps can then be translated into research questions.

Below we have specified multiple pages where you can read more about theory and theory formation.

## Think more about your theory

We have collected various topics for you to read more about below.
