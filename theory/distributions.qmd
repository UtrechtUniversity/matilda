This is the landing page for everything related to the <i> distributions </i> of your [constructs](../theory/your-study/constructs.qmd) of interest.

With distribution we mean how your scores are distributed across the units you are studying. For [intensive longitudinal data](../intensive-longitudinal-data.qmd) we are often interested in how scores are distributed over time within a given unit (e.g., within a person). We may also be interested in how scores are distributed across units (e.g., across multiple persons). 

The distributions of variables imply what scores you should expect for the [process](../processes.qmd) you are studying. Having knowledge about the distribution of your variables of interest is useful for informing your designing your [measurement instrument](../measurement/instrument.qmd) and [sampling design](../measurement/sampling.qmd). It is also important to take into account when you analyse collected data.
