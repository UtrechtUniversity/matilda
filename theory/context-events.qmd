This is the landing page for everything related to the <i> context and events </i> that may affect the [process](../processes.qmd) you are studying.

Psychological or other social science processes are likely to be affected by the context the process operates in, and external events that may occur along the way. It is important to consider the importance of the context and events for your process of interest, so you know what to measure about the context and events in addition to the core [constructs](../your-study/constructs.qmd) of your process. You may also tailor your [sampling design](../measurement/sampling.qmd) to events.
