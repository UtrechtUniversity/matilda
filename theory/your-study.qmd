Your study consists of your research question, theory, conceptual definitions, measurement design, procedural design, analyses, results, and conclusions. In a good study, all of these different parts of a study are tailored to each other. 

The MATILDA website aims to help you align your research question with your measurement design and analyses, in the context of studies that use [intensive longitudinal data (ILD)](../intensive-longitudinal-data.qmd) to study social science [processes](../processes.qmd). 

Below we have specified various topics to think about with respect to the outset of your study - such as your research question and goals, theory, and research paradigm.
