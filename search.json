It is important to carefully think about how one construct relates to the other, and more specifically when. Does the construct always affect the other, or does it only occur at a specific time?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Sleep quality and positive affect 2\n\n\n\n\n\nBatu believes that a person’s sleep quality only influences their positive affect in the morning and early afternoon. During the day, the effect of sleep quality on positive affect wears off.\n\n\n\nb) Different measurements may refer to different time points or intervals. It is important to consider to what time point or interval a measurement refers to, in order to concretely hypothesize about the dynamic relations between variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Sleep quality and positive affect 3\n\n\n\n\n\nBatu measures sleep quality in the morning at the same time of the first measurement of positive affect. However, the measurement of sleep quality refers to the preceding night, which is an interval of time that happens before the measurement is taken. The items for positive affect refer to how the participant feels at the moment and therefore refer to that specific measurement occasion.\n\n\n\nc) Aggregation of measurements (e.g., averages) may lead to different theoretical interpretations. It is important to consider the difference between measurements and aggregated measurements with regards to the substantive interpretation of the relations between variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Sleep quality and positive affect 4\n\n\n\n\n\nGulce is interested in a similar relation as Batu between sleep quality and positive affect.

See citation info.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMany psychological processes switch between two or more different regimes. For example, an individual can alter between healthy and depressed periods over a period of time. Or an emotion process may show switches between negative, neutral and positive moods. You will find some theoretical considerations on this page for when you want to measure such psychological processes.\n\nWhat is a regime?\nThere is no clear-cut definition of what a regime is, but every regime has a certain degree of stability. Stability has something to do with the notion of a stable state in dynamical systems theory, also called stable equilibrium or attractor state. At the value(s) of a stable state, “things” are in balance. Small perturbations away from the state will have a short-lived effect, because the system will always return back to the stable state. A regime can be considered the dynamic process around this stable state.\nWhen a system has multiple stable states, we can observe multiple regimes when we measure this system over time. These regimes will be processes that each move around a different value, because the corresponding stable states are also (by definition) characterized by different values. Additionally, they may also differ in their dynamical features. For example, in a depression regime, the autoregressive effect may be larger than is the case in a healthy regime. So, regimes are defined by a mean value and the dynamics around this mean value.\n\n\nRegime switching\nA main topic of research is when and how regime switches take place. Regime switches are often sudden: from one moment to the next, the process of interest is completely taken over by a different regime. When some regimes are more preferable than others (e.g., relapse vs. recovery in addiction processes), we would like to prevent certain switches from happening, and trigger others to happen. This is especially the case for switches that are irreversible, think of global warming, that will have permanent consequences for the planet if not held under a certain maximum. Another type of switching that is possible but difficult to reverse is hysteresis.\nA system in isolation would not change regimes, given that the system itself does not change. After all, a regime is stable by definition. So, a regime switch must be caused by an external event. There are several events we could think of, for example, the death of a loved one will almost certainly put a person in a regime of grief. Other events are more subtle, for example, the gradual decrease of public trust that suddenly leads to rioting behavior at a certain threshold. In this case, public trust is called a control variable. Because the change in the control variable is often gradual, the regime switch can be quite unpredictable, and the change in the outcome variable quite disproportionate. For this reason, this kind of regime switches have intrigued researchers for a long time, and has found is own mathematical (sub)disciplines in bifurcation theory and catastrophe theory.\n\n\nHow should I measure a regime-switching process?\nDepending on your goal, there are different questions to address in the measurement design of a regime-switching process. Here are three goals you can have in mind, each with some measurement questions you could consider:\n\nI want to establish the existence of regimes in a process\n\nHow many regimes do you think there are to distinguish?\nHow long do you think one regime will typically last?\nWhat do I want to capture about the regimes? Only differences in means, or also in dynamics? For the latter, you will need to have higher granularity.\n\nI want to predict regime switches\n\nWhat do you think triggers the switches? If it is a control variable crossing a threshold, what are possible control variables you can measure?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{de jong2023,\n  author = {de Jong, Daan},\n  title = {Regime-Switching Processes},\n  date = {2023-05-26},\n  url = {https://sophieberkhout.github.io/matilda//substantive-theory/ergodicity/regime-switching-processes.html},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nde Jong, D.

Censoring as a result of coarse-grained categories at the bottom of the scale\n\nImagine a scale with the lowest item being “No headache at all or very slight headache”. The item will be selected by those who are experiencing no headache at all as well as those who have a small amount of headache, meaning that the item has low resolution and low sensitivity in measuring those with small amount of headache.

Censoring as a result of measuring a bipolar construct with a unipolar scale\n\nSome affect and mood items, like sad, can be thought of as measuring one half of a bipolar latent continuum, say, happy–sad. As such, being not at all sad is equivalent to being neither happy nor sad. In this case, measuring one half of the latent construct with a unipolar scale can be thought of as systematically left-sensoring the data. As Falcaro et al. (2013, p. 12) put it:\n\nThe depression score variable in this study suffered a marked floor effect at 0. We decided to treat this as a special case of interval censoring. Under this model we are assuming that those who score at the floor of the test could have been further differentiated into varying levels of non-depression if there had been appropriate additional items. Most people would call such variation in non-depression variation in happiness but, in the absence of actual happiness items and evidence of their tapping the same dimension as the depression items, the labelling of any such implicit variability is best left open.\n\n\n\nC.

It has been suggested that dietary intake (Ruf et al., 2021), smoking behavior (Liu, 2007), and certain affective processes (Lu et al., 2019) might be better explained in this framework. It is worth noting that such processes can explain the excess number of zero values (or zero inflation) in the data; if the data skewed beyond zero inflation, the “on” process still needs to account for a “floor effect” that is present above zero."

    "text": "Disregarding event-relations: Unconditional Constructs\n\nWhen collecting ILD from the everyday life of participants, measurements likely almost always capture some degree of situational influences on the measured construct. However, not all of these influences necessarily need to be accounted for in an ILD design:\nWhen we do not explicitly account for situational influences on our constructs, we implicitly treat those influences as random error. This random error is in turn assumed to cancel itself out - some influences are positive, some negative - over a sufficiently large number of independent observations. Depending on the specific research context, this may be a more or less appropriate assumption to make.\nIn any case, making this assumption is most reasonable if ones substantive theory states that situational factors are not of a big importance to the process under study. In this case, the process is treated to be unconditional, that is, independent of (unobserved) situational influences. This means, when the research question concerns a construct which can be reasonably argued to vary or change independently of situational influences, one may not need to explicitly measure situational factors in an ILD design.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 1: Conscientiousness in Daily Life\n\n\n\n\n\nFrancesca is interested in studying the manifestation of trait conscientiousness in daily life. Three times a day, the ESM protocol asks participants “How conscientious are you right now?”. No situational variables are measured.\nIn the resulting time series, the means of the conscientiousness scores of different people correlate highly with trait conscientiousness measured with a cross-sectional personality trait questionnaire.\nThe researcher interprets this result in the following way: Trait conscientiousness manifests as the unconditional mean (i.e. the mean of the entire time series; not corrected for situational factors) of being conscientious in daily life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubstantive assumptions\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you believe the construct is unconditional and can be measured without accounting for context, you are making an number of implicit assumptions:\n\nThe construct occurs independently of specific situational factors (e.g. mood)\nThere is not important change or variation in the construct that is due to situational factors (e.g.”How do you feel in general?” vs. “How do you feel after a fight?”)\nThe construct is well-defined\n\n\nRead more:\n\n[When is a construct well-defined?]\n\n\n\n\n\nOften it is not reasonable to assume that situations and context play no role in our measurements.In the next section, two ways of accounting for event-relation of constructs will be discussed."

    "text": "Contrasts: Constructs affected by Events\nOften, research questions either concern a) the effect that specific situations have on a construct or b) the degree to which a person is prone to reacting to specific events. This means, we are interested in measuring how a construct changes after an event occured. Here, we call these kinds of event-relations contrasts.\nIn a contrast event-relation, we are interested in the difference in a construct before and after an event occurred. In other words, we are interested in capturing the increase in construct Y, that is due to situation/event S.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContrasts as Model Features\n\n\n\n\n\nContrasts can be assessed by defining the hypothesiszed effects in a model. For example, we can express them as:\n\\[Y{t} = c + b1*S{t-1} + e{t}\\] Here, coefficient b1 expresses the reaction/contrast created by the event. If no event is reported, b1 will not influence Y at time point t.\nNote: this is a simple example meant to illustrate the functionality of model features to account for event-relations. In practice models can be more complicated or account for contrast event-relations in alternative ways, for example by measuring S as continuous and defining cross-lagged effects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 2: Conscientiousness in Daily Life\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrancesca would also like to study people’s reactions to mess in the workplace as a sign of trait conscientiousness. The hypothesis is that very conscientious people, will strongly react to encountering mess and will report to feel uncomfortable after. For this, they come up with an esm protocol measuring two variables, multiple times a day. The first variable is S = “Right now, to what extend are you in a messy environment?”, the second variable is Y = “comfort/discomfort”Right now, to what extend did you feel comfortable/uncomfortable?.\nIn a model, S can be defined to have a lag-1 to lag-d relationship with current measures of Y. With this, the researcher is able to estimate the effect of S on Y. This coefficient can be interpreted to represent a participants tendency to be reactive to mess.\nNote: defining and measuring such effects heavily assumes an appropriate selection of time scales.\n\n\n\nIn summary, contrast event-relations require the measurement of relevant situational factors, such that central constructs (and changes therein) can be related to the occurrence of events in later models. Through this, we can assess a) if certain situations affect a construct, but also b) to what extend people are reactive/sensitive to particular types of events.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConstrasts: Substantive assumptions\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you believe there is a contrast relationship like the above, you are making an number of implicit assumptions:\n\nY and S are conceptually distinct constructs\nYou are interested in the (causal) effect of S on Y\nYou are assuming that the variables are measured at the correct time scale\nYou are assuming that Y is a function of S\nYou are assuming that Y and S are well-defined\nYou are assuming that you are measuring the construct at an appropriate time scale.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more: Measuring at the appropriate time scale\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTime scale landing page\n[Causal Inference with ILD]"

    "text": "Conditional Event-Relations of Constructs:\nConditional event-relations differ from contrasts in the substantive assumptions about the relationship between Y and S. Concretely, here we assume that Y only occurs or is only measurable within occurrences of S. This is the case if a construct, per definition, cannot be observed in absence of a situational pre-condition. Y and S may therefore be measured retrospectively and at the same time. As S is a necessary condition for Y, no lag between the constructs has to be specified. In ESM studies, we often see this in the from of event-contingent designs: a more elaborate questionnaire protocol is initiated only after a specific type of event was reported.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 3: Conscientiousness in Daily Life\n\n\n\n\n\nFurthermore, Francesca is interested in assessing another state measure of daily conscientiousness. Concretely, she thinks “hardworkingness” is an interesting variable to consider and that high means in state-hardworkingness will correlate with trait Conscientiousness. At first glance, hardworkingness appeared to be a normal state variable, which could be measured without accounting for situational factors.\nHowever, at second glance Francesca encounters a problem: When measuring “How hardworking are you right now?”, not all measurement occasions are equally important, as there simply is not a lot of work to do during weekends or in the evening. Therefore, Francesca includes a situational variable S into the procedure, and couples the assessment of Y to positive responses on S. If “Right now, is there work to be done?” (S) is answered with ‘yes’, Y (“How hardworking are you right now?”) can be asked.\n\n\n\n\nSubstantive Assumptions\nIf you believe the construct is conditional and needs to be measured within specific contexts, you are making an number of implicit assumptions:\n\nYou are assuming that S and Y are conceptually inter-dependent rather than causally connected\nYou are assuming that you can only gain a valid measurement of construct Y if S currently occurs\nYou are assuming your construct is well-defined\nYou are assuming that you are measuring the construct at an appropriate time scale.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Event-Contingent Design]\n[ESM/EMA protocols for measuring events (link to ESM textbook)]"

    "text": "Multiple items for reasons of reliability\nHaving multiple items to measure the same construct can be helpful, because it allows using internal consistency reliability approaches. For these techniques, the general idea is that the items all measure the same underlying construct. The shared variance among those items is the result of variation in the true construct, while the un-shared variance among the items is considered measurement error.\nMultiple items that measure the same construct, combined with internal consistency reliability approaches can be used…\na) to estimate the reliability of (a set of) items for measuring a construct of interest. That is, to validate a questionnaire.\nb) to account for measurement error for a construct of interest during an analysis. That is, to prevent measurement error from biasing the results of analyses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Social support 3\n\n\n\n\n\nUme has developed a short experience-sampling questionnaire where three items are used to measure daily experienced received social support. The items are “I felt supported by others today…”, “I felt grateful to others today…” and “Other people had my back today…”. The shared variance in the items over time is considered variance in the ‘true’ received social support, and the unique variance in the items over time is considered measurement error.\n\n\n\nWell-known internal consistency approaches for interindividual (e.g., cross-sectional) studies are reliability measures such as Cronbach’s Alpha, and latent variable models such as factor models and Item Response Theory models. These techniques cannot be used directly on intensive longitudinal data, but extensions and similar alternatives are available.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Social support 4\n\n\n\n\n\nUme uses a reflective linear factor model with the three items as indicators, and one latent variable that should reflect ‘received social support’. They use the model to estimate the reliability for their short questionnaire, as part of their validation study. Reliability will be high when the items consistently increase and decrease together over the repeated measures (if they covary a lot of time).\nIf the questionnaire is deemed valid based on Ume’s study, in future studies researchers can use the same factor model to correct for measurement error in their analyses.\n\n\n\nWhen using multiple items for reliability purposes, it is important to consider\n\nthat each internal consistency reliability technique is based on theoretical assumptions, and hence has theoretical implications. It is important to carefully think about what measurement model is appropriate for your research question and context.\nit is possible to evaluate reliability and correct for measurement error with single item measures as well (see: Reliability for single item measures (for single or multiple subjects)).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more: Aggregating multiple items for measuring a construct\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Multiple item measures: Sum-scores or mean-scores vs latent variable models]\n[Formative versus reflective latent variable models]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more: Evaluating the quality of multiple-item measures\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[When are my measurements ‘good enough’?]\n[Internal consistency reliability for ILD]\n[Qualitative assessments of measurement quality]\n[Predictive & convergent/divergent validity for ILD]"

    "section": "Multiple items to mirror interindividual difference questionnaires",
    "text": "Multiple items to mirror interindividual difference questionnaires\nResearchers may want to use constructs established in interindividual difference research for intra-individual difference studies using ILD: For example, constructs such as ‘positive affect’ or ‘introversion’. In that case, the first intuition may be to simply take the questionnaires from inter-individual difference research and adapt them to the intra-individual context.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: PANAS 1\n\n\n\n\n\nA researcher wants to measure intra-individual differences in ‘Positive Affect’ and ‘Negative Affect’, constructs established in the context of individual differences research. It is commonly measured with the PANAS Schedule (Tran, 2020; Watson et al., 1988). It measures how much positive and negative affect people tend to generally experience, and is used to study trait differences between people in how much positive and negative affect the tend to experience, and how this relates to other differences between people (e.g., their sex or personality traits).\nThe researcher takes the original items of the PANAS scale, and but changes the phrasing to suit intra-individual difference research.\nFor example: The original PANAS instructions were “Indicate the extent you have felt this way over the past week.” for various adjectives (e.g., “irritable”, “guilty”, “afraid”), rated on a 5 point likert scale (“very slightly/not at all” - “extremely”). The researcher changes the instruction to “Indicate the extent you have felt this way in the last hour.”, keeping the remaining the same.\n\n\n\nIt is important to consider the following:\n\nconstructs established interindividual difference research may be less relevant, or irrelevant for studying intra-individual differences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample PANAS 2\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on interindividual difference research, the items “irritable”, “guilty”, “afraid” (and others) are considered suitable items for establishing consistent differences in ‘overall negative affect’ among different people (Watson et al., 1988). Based on factor modeling studies (Wedderhoff et al., 2021), it has been established that people that tend to overall feel more irritable than other people, tend to also feel more guilty and afraid than other people. This property is captured in a latent variable, which is considered to capture differences in people’s overall ‘negative affect’.\nThis however doesn’t mean such a latent variable will also capture differences in a persons’ intra-individual differences well, that is, how a person’s affect fluctuates over time.\nIf we apply the ‘negative affect’ latent variable to intra-individual differences over time, using the same adjectives as the original scale, this would imply the following pattern over time: If a person feels relatively irritable at a certain occasion, that person tends to also feel relatively guilty and afraid at that same occasion.\nFor example, consider that whether a person feels irritable at a given occasion, and whether the person also feels guilty and afraid, depends mainly on the context the participant is in at that occasion - rather than this it is a result of a latent variable ‘negative affect’. For some experiences they may feel all three emotions to a large extent due to the nature of the event (participant is publicly called out on a big mistake), while for other experiences they may be inclined to feel mostly one of them (participant encounters an angry swarm of bees during a walk).\nIf so, the concept of general negative effect may not be directly relevant for studying how people’s emotions fluctuate over time (intra-individual differences); while it is very suitable for studying general tendencies of people compared to other people (interindividual differences).\n\n\n\n\nquestionnaires for intra-individual difference studies, often need to have different qualities than questionnaires on inter-individual differences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: PANAS 3\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider the PANAS adjective ‘guilty’, for which participants now would “Indicate the extent you have felt this way in the last hour.” If one collects relatively few repeated measures over a short time span, participants may often or even always respond ‘not at all/very slightly’ for the majority of measures. This would result in little to no within-person variance in the repeated measures of guilt, making intra-individual difference analyses difficult or impossible.\nIn comparison, for studying (stable) interindividual differences or traits, the timing of measurements is often less important compared to getting a representative varied sample of observations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: PANAS 4\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the original PANAS for interindividual differences consists of 20 items, we may prefer a shorter questionnaire for an intra-individual difference study where we collect repeated measures every hour.\n\n\n\n\nvalid and reliable questionnaires from inter-individual difference research, may not be valid and reliable for intra-individual difference research.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: PANAS 5\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the original PANAS for interindividual differences may have a reliability between .8-.9 (refs), an adapted PANAS for intra-individual differences may have a much lower or higher reliability (Schuurman & Hamaker, 2019).\n\n\n\nHence, questionnaires or items adapted from interindividual difference research need to be completely re-validated.\nWe generally recommend to avoid copying constructs from interindividual research directly to intra-individual difference studies unless there are very good theoretical reasons to do so. That is, the constructs need to make sense for studying intra-individual differences, for the given research question, and context, preferably backed by empirical evidence. In many cases it may be necessary, and more fruitful to establish (new) constructs tailored to intra-individual differences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more: Interindividual versus intraindividual differences\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Intra-individual versus interindividual difference studies]"

It is important to think about for a given construct whether and how these different goals can be reconciled with each other. This will depend on the goals, the nature of the construct, the design of the items, and how the items will be aggregated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Social support 5\n\n\n\n\n\nMax wants to get a good impression of someone’s daily experienced received social support. They care about both content validity, and they also want to evaluate the measures’ reliability, to make sure it captures as little measurement error as possible.\nTo ensure their measure is content valid, Max breaks down the construct into different aspects, measured with different items.\nRather than using a single item asking ’How much social support did you receive today?“, they asked multiple questions like”Did you receive help with your job today?“,”Did you feel you could reach out for emotional support from your friends/family/colleagues today?“, and”Did you rely on financial support today?“. In this way, various distinct aspects of receiving social support are covered by the multiple items.\nMax uses a reflective factor model to estimate the internal consistent reliability of the items. However, because this reliability estimate relies on the idea that what is reliable is the variance that is shared among the items, all the unique variability in the items is considered measurement error. Hence, all the unique contributions of the items, which is why Max used multiple items with respect to content validity, are not considered in this reliability estimate. As a result, the reliability estimate is likely to underestimate the true reliability of the measure.\nMax’ internal consistency reliability approach, does not mesh well with their approach to content validity."

These data are typically collected via self-report with smart phone surveys, or via observation or trackers (MATILDA focuses on self-report with smart phone surveys).\nData that consist of many repeated measures for a single unit and variable is called a time series. In other words, ILD consist of time series for multiple persons, for one or more variables. In practice however, sometimes ILD is also used to refer to the time series of one unit or person.\nThis type of data stands in contrast with other common data types in Psychology, such as  cross-sectional data  and  panel data . Cross-sectional data consist of scores measured at a single time points for many persons. Panel data consist of a few repeated measures, for many persons.\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{schuurman2023,\n  author = {Schuurman, Noémi K.},\n  title = {About {Intensive} {Longitudinal} {Data}},\n  date = {2023-07-17},\n  url = {https://sophieberkhout.github.io/matilda//intensive-longitudinal-data.html},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nSchuurman, N.

In this case, measuring more often (as would be the case in an ESM/EMA design) would not be beneficial.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more: Number of Repeated Measurements\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[How many repeated measurements do I need?]"

    "text": "Granularity: Combination of time frame and time interval\nWhen the time frame of the measurement instrument and the time interval between measurements are the same, this implies that the time frames are spaced back to back. In that case, all parts of the ongoing process are captured by exactly one measurement frame.\n\n\nAlternatively, the time frame may be shorter than the time interval between the measurements. This tends to be the case when using the momentary time frame (i.e., ‘’right now’’), but is also quite common in panel research. In the latter case, the time frame is often determined by the instrument that is used and that has been validated with that particular specification. In these cases, there is a proportion of the process that is not covered by any of the measurements.\n\nIt also happens that the time frame is actually longer than the time interval between measurements; in that case the time frames overlap. A typical case is when participants are asked to rate themselves ‘’in general’’.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: ESM/EMA study\n\n\n\n\n\nPia is using ESM/EMA to study fluctuations in anxiety throughout the day. She is asking participants to indicate how anxious they feel right now, at random time points throughout the day. In this case, most of the ongoing process is not covered by the measurements, although such a momentary snapshot may be representative of the levels of anxiety experience in a considerable period prior and after the specific measurement occasion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Daily diary study\n\n\n\n\n\nSophie is performing a daily diary study, in which participants are asked at the end of every day questions such as: ‘’On average, how energetic did you feel today?’’. In this case, it is somewhat unclear where the participants start the interval for which they will provide an average; if they consider the start of the day when they got up, there may be a considerable part of the ongoing process (between their reporting the preceding day, and their getting op the following day) that is not captured by the measurements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Panel study\n\n\n\n\n\nJack is performing a panel study in which participants are asked once every two years how happy they felt during the past week. In this case, only about 1% of the ongoing process is covered by the measurement frames.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more: Aiming your Study’s Granularity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Measurement Burst Designs]\n[Measurement Burst Designs: Event Contingent Bursts]"

In the social sciences, we often cannot directly observe the constructs we are interested in. Instead, we try to indirectly measure them, for example with questionnaires.\nIn order to measure our constructs well, we need to build a good understanding of them. This is a key part of both our substantive and measurement theories. A first step is to conceptually define your construct - you define what you mean exactly with your construct. After that, you can figure out how to operationally define your construct - how to measure it.\nBelow we have specified multiple topics that may help conceptually define your construct."
