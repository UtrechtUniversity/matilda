This is the landing page for everything related to the <i> measurement instrument </i> used for measuring your [constructs](../your-study/constructs.qmd) of interest. Note that if you use a single item to measure your construct, that item is your instrument (and then the [item landing page](item.qmd) may be most helpful).

They way your instrument is designed, from the order of your items to the length of your questionnaire, will directly impact what you measure. 

## Think more about instrument design

We have collected various topics for you to read more about below.
