This is the landing page for everything related to the <i> items </i> used for measuring your [constructs](../theory/your-study/constructs.qmd) of interest.

They way your items are designed, from the questions you ask to the answer options you provide, will directly impact what you measure. 

## Think more about item design

We have collected various topics for you to read more about below.
