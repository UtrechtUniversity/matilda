This page is about methods for determining the reliability of <i>
[single item measures](../instrument/single-item-multiple-item-measures.qmd)</i>.

Reliability is a prerequisite for the [validity](../validation.qmd) of your item. Unreliable
measurements can lead to biased and hence inaccurate parameter estimates
when you analyse them.

So far, the available methods for determining the reliability of single
item measures are based on the test-retest framework. In the following,
we first discuss this framework, followed by two methods for estimating
reliability for single item measures.

# The test-retest framework for classical test theory

The main idea behind the test-retest framework is that when a construct
does not change, repeated measurements of that construct should produce
the same result. If the results of the measurements indeed do not change
they are reliable. If the results of the repeated measurements differ,
this can be ascribed to measurement error.

In classical test theory, this implies that each measurement $y_t$ at
timepoint $t$ consists of a stable part of the score $\theta$ that is
refered to as the *true score*, and a *measurement error* $\epsilon_t$
that is specific to the measurement:

$$
y_{t} = \theta + \epsilon_{t}.
$$ In this scenario, measurement error can be separated from true scores
by determining what part of the measurements is stable over time, and
what is variable over time.

## The test-retest framework for ILD

The challenge for ILD is that the true score is often expected to vary
over time:

$$
y_{t} = \theta_t + \epsilon_{t}.
$$ As such, we need a way to distinguish the variance in the true score
from variance due to measurement error for a single item in our repeated
measures, if we want to use a test-retest approach. This generally
requires making some assumptions about how the true score and
measurement error vary over time.

Below we will discuss two methods that do this, and that can be used for
measurements of single items and single or multiple participants: The
'measurement error autoregressive model' and the 'immediate test-retest
method'.

# The Measurement Error Autoregressive Model

The Measurement Error Autoregressive Model (MEAR(1) model) uses a dynamic model - the autoregressive
model - to separate what are true scores from what are random
measurement errors [see @schuurman_measurement_2019;
@schuurman_incorporating_2015]. The part of the scores that are a result of the
autoregressive process (including residuals) are considered the true
part of the scores. The remainder is considered measurement error.

![MEAR(1) Model](../../resources/images/MEAR(1).png){#fig-MEAR1 fig-align="center"
width="500"}

The model is depicted graphically in @fig-MEAR1. The model is specified
as follows with two equations (note: we use the notation consistent with
@schuurman_measurement_2019). Firstly, the measurement equation
(measurement model) is specified as:

$$ 
y_t = \mu +\tilde{y}_t + \epsilon_t.\\ 
$$ In the above equation the observed score at each timepoint $t$,
$\theta_t$ , consists of

1)  mean $\mu$ that is stable over time;
2)  $\tilde{y}_t$ which is the part of the score that is the result of
    an autoregressive process at each time point;
3)  $\epsilon\_{t}$ which is the part of the score that is the result
    of measurement error at each time point.

The measurement errors \$\epsilon\_t \$ are assumed to be normally
distributed with a mean of zero, and a measurement error variance
$\sigma_\epsilon^2$.

The autoregressive process for $\tilde{y}_t$ is specified as follows in
the transition equation of the model:

$$
\tilde{y}_t = \phi \tilde{y}_{t-1} + \omega_t
$$ Here, current scores $\tilde{y}_{t}$ is predicted by itself at the
nearest previous occassion $\tilde{y}_{t-1}$ through autoregressive
parameter $\phi$. Given that the scores are only predicted by the
nearest previous occassion, this is an autoregressive model of order 1
(an AR(1) model). The dynamic residuals $\omega_t$, are assumed to be
normally distributed with a mean of zero and variance $\sigma_\omega^2$.

Important to note is that the dynamic residuals have a key feature that
distinguishes them from measurement errors: The dynamic residuals carry
over from one occassion to the next via the autoregressive effect, while
the measurement error do not [@schuurman_measurement_2019;
@schuurman_incorporating_2015]. This can also be seen from tracing the
arrows in @fig-MEAR1.

<!-- Misschien iets zeggen over hoe dynamic 'error' misschien niet het beste woord is omdat het deel is van de ware score, en dat sommige mensen dit dus ook innovations noemen, of je zou het dynamic residuals kunnen noemen -->

<!-- Nu al iets herschreven -->

## Example: dynamic residuals

Ayoko wants to study the dynamics in her enthusiasm. She gathers
personal measurements on her phone in the morning, in the afternoon and
in the evening. On Sunday afternoon she goes to the cinema and greatly
enjoys a movie. This results in a spike in her enthusiasm. The effect of
seeing this movie on her enthusiasm still lingers in the evening. In
other words, the autoregressive effect has "carried over" this "dynamic
residual" from the afternoon to the evening.
:::

Dynamic residuals are sometimes also referred to as 'innovations' or
'dynamic errors'. However, note that even though they are sometimes
referred to as errors, they are in fact part of the variance in the true
scores.

For the MEAR(1) model, the variance of the true scores is given by:

$$
\sigma_{\tilde{y}}^2 = \frac{\sigma_\omega^2}{1-\phi^2}.
$$

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Example: measurement error

On Tuesday morning, Ayoko's finger slips when rating her enthusiasm on
her phone, and she accidentally records the highest possible value. The
effect of this error is limited to this single measurement and will not
affect the next measurement.
:::

The total variance of the observed scores $y_{t}$ in the MEAR(1) model
consists of the variance due to the autoregressive process
$\sigma_{\tilde{y}}^2$ and the measurement error variance
$\sigma_\epsilon^2$.

In order to calculate the reliability of the construct we calculate the
proportion of total variance $y_{t}$ to the true score variance
$\sigma_{\tilde{y}}^2$:

$$
rel(y) = \frac{\sigma_{\tilde{y}}^2}{\sigma_{\tilde{y}}^2 + \sigma_\epsilon^2}
$$

It is important to note that dynamic residuals $\omega_t$ and
measurement errors $\epsilon_t$ can only be distinguished from each
other by the fact that the effect of the dynamic residuals carry over to
the next measurement. This has several important implications.

-   First, it means that any unobserved effect that is not carried over
    to the next measurement is ascribed to measurement error. As such,
    the reliability estimate of the MEAR(1) model is likely to be an
    underestimate of the true reliability.

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Example: measurement error?

On Thursday afternoon, Ayoko has a tasty cookie right before a measuring
her enthusiasm. The effect of this cookie on her enthusiasm likely does
not carry over to the measurement in the evening. However, the cookie
did temporarily boost her enthusiasm. Hence, the boost was a true score,
but the MEAR(1) model will consider it measurement error. Hence, the
reliability will be underestimated.

:::

-   Second, it means that when the autoregressive parameter is zero and
    dynamic residuals do not carry over, the model is not identified.
    The closer the autoregressive parameter is to zero, the harder it
    will be to estimate the model [@schuurman_measurement_2019;
    @schuurman_incorporating_2015].
    
In general, note that the MEAR(1) assumes a specific model to separate dynamic
process from measurement errors. If the model is incorrect, this will
affect the reliability estimates. For example, Example "measurement error?" above illustrates that if not all dynamics are accounted for in the model, this may for lead to an
underestimation of the reliability. In that case, the chosen time
interval may also affect the reliability estimates for example [@schuurman_measurement_2019]. 

Note that the MEAR(1) has been extended in various ways, and the general idea behind it can also be applied to other dynamic models (see below).

## Extensions of the MEAR(1) approach

The MEAR(1) model can be extended to capture more complicated
dynamics - in essence, the idea behind it can be generalized to any
dynamic model; where the dynamic model part is considered the reliable
part of scores, and the remainder measurement error. So far, the MEAR(1)
model has been extended to account for multiple variables with a VAR(1)
model with correlated measurement errors, and to multilevel data
(modeling multiple persons) [@schuurman_measurement_2019].

# The immediate TRT method

In the immediate test-retest (TRT) method [@dejonckheere_assessing_2022]
makes use of an adjusted sampling design: In this method, measurements
of the construct of interest are quickly followed by another
measurement. For example, within a questionnaire of eight items, one of
the items would be repeated after these eight items, with a minimum
number of items in between.

The reasoning behind this method is that it is unlikely that the true
score changed between the first and second measurement of the construct.
Hence, any difference between these repeated measurements, which are
taken very close in time, is considered to be measurement error.

Specifically, under this assumption measurement error variance can be
expressed as the expected value (i.e., average) of the squared
differences between the first and repeated measurements, divided by two:

$$
\sigma_\epsilon^2 = \frac{E[\Delta_{trt}^2]}{2}
$$ In order to calculate reliability, this measurement error variance
can be divided by the variance of all measurements that have a replicate
measurement:

$$
rel(y) = \frac{\sigma_\epsilon^2}{\sigma_{trt}^2}
$$

The clear benefit of this method is that can easily be calculated.
However, it does require various assumptions:

1.  The true score does not change between the initial and replicate
        measurement.

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Example: No measurement error?

Ayoko also wants to measure and model Tobias' enthusiasm. She gathers
personal measurements in the morning, afternoon and evening, and wants
to know how reliable Tobias' responses are. She uses the immediate
test-retest method in order to get an estimate.

Like Ayoko, Tobias likes cookies. During his afternoon he eats a cookie
just in between the original measurement of enthusiasm and the
repetition. He answers according to his true scores - but they are
different for the first and replicate measurement. This would lead to an
underestimate of the reliability by the immediate RTR method.
:::

2.  There are no recall effects among the initial and replicate
    measurement.

3.  People do not always strive for consistency of their responses.

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Example 2: No measurement error?

During a particular measurement, Tobias is not very sure how
enthusiastic he feels. He decides to just go with a number and feels
that 45 should be relatively close. Quickly after giving this rating
Tobias is presented with another question about his enthusiasm. "Didn't I
already fill this out?" Tobias thinks to himself. "What was it again? 45?" 
He responds 45 again. 

The first measurement had some measurement error in it, and the replicate
measurement is identical due to remembrance effects and Tobias' desire to be consistent. There is hence no difference between the first and replicate measurement, which for the TRT method implies there is no measurement error. Hence, in this case, the TRT method would
overestimate the reliability.

<!-- Here are additional options: There could be one where the participants remembers the initial score and repeats it although they feel differently at the replicate measure, or perhaps one where they feel different, realize this change, and then go back to the first score and change their initial rating to be consistent with the replicate measurement (although this latter one does not have to affect the reliability estimate in a negative way, it surely messes up your measurements). etc -->
:::

If these assumptions are violated, the reliability estimate based on this test-retest method may be either underestimated or overestimated, depending on the violation(s).
